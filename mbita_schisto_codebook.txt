This file includes 3,663 observations and 12 variables. 

Each observation corresponds to a measurement on a single child. The data are in long format by study year (year) and village (vid). 

All of the IgG antibody responses to SEA and Sm25 are in units of median florescence intensity minus background (MFI-bg) and were measured in a multiplex bead assay on a BioPlex 200 Luminex machine at KEMRI.  Note that there are 237 children with serology results but no Kato-Katz stool results.
